1)The first thing you have to do is to open your xampp control panel
then turn on APACHE and MYSQL then navigate to Mysql Admin and create a new database called 
"hotel_management" and import the sql file that you'll find the repository.

2)next step is to download the javafx jdk "javafx-sdk-17.0.12"
and also the jfoenix "9.0.10" jar 

3)What you have to do next is to include them in the project structure 
File/Project Structure/Libraries and add the lib files to the libraries of the projects 

Ps:Making this steps ususally will be enough for the project ro run correctly and with no issues 
if you came across any problem please don't hesitate to ask me for help , Thank you .
